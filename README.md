# Personal Brain Project

## Overview
Welcome to the **Personal Brain Project** - your digital repository for technical knowledge! This innovative platform leverages the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide insightful summaries and answer questions about technical papers and books. 

Whether you are a researcher, a student, or simply a knowledge enthusiast, the Personal Brain Project is designed to enhance your learning experience by making information retrieval seamless and interactive.
